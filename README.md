Welcome to the Attack on Titan API repository! This repository provides a RESTful API that allows you to retrieve information about characters, episodes, locations, organizations, and titans from the popular anime and manga series Attack on Titan.

The API offers various endpoints to query for information about different aspects of the series. Here's a brief overview of the available endpoints:

**URL**: [https://api.attackontitanapi.com/](https://api.attackontitanapi.com/)

- `/` (base url): Responds with an object of all the available endpoints

- `/characters`: Retrieve information about characters from the series, including their name, image, age, gender, affiliation, and other details.

- `/episodes`: Get details about episodes from the series, such as their name, image, characters, and other details.

- `/titans`: Retrieve information about the different titans featured in the series, including their name, image, height, abilities, and other characteristics.

The API is built using Node.js and Express.js and is designed to be easy to use and extend. It is also open source, so you can contribute to its development and make it even better. We currently have no rate limits and API key requirement. We are also currrently developing a NextJS website to use as a full fledge documentation and are looking for contributors!
